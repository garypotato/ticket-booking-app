# train-ticket booking application
What I want to do in this app is simple but informative. This website is based on mobile-first design so the font-size:pencil2: will change according to different screen width. Users can still use PC brower but some functions will not function well. However, I am happy with that because I focus on user experiense.
##  About this app
This app is based on React, Redux, React-redux, redux-thunk. Of course, some third libraries like classnames.
## What I am happy with 
### * the cityselector component
